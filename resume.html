Summary
<br>
I'm always ready to learn something new; in fact, the pursuit of knowledge I don't yet possess is one of my driving factors in daily life. The burning question thus becomes, "How can my vast array of skills, knowledge, and experience help you and your company assist me in learning even more?"
