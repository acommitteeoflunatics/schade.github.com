Summary
<br>
<br>
I'm always ready to learn something new; in fact, the pursuit of knowledge I don't yet possess is one of my driving factors in daily life. 
<br>
<br>
The burning question thus becomes, "How can my vast array of skills, knowledge, and experience help you and your company assist me in learning even more?"
